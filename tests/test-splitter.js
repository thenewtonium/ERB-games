text1 = "For those of you who haven’t managed to open your curtains today, or even get out of bed … it is sunny today. So, something is wrong.  It is mid-February, we are in week four of Lent Term, and it is sunny outside? Disaster or misfortune awaits. That means you’re going to find your bicycle tyre is flat. Or some kind soul has bent the back wheel of your bike. Or you are going to lose a folder of lecture notes. Or your laptop is going to claim all the work you did last Term has ceased to exist because you haven’t been nice enough to your laptop. Or you are going to see Your Significant Other doing something with someone else’s YSO, doing stuff that only YSOs do with their own YSO, not someone else’s YSO. There is supposed to be a theorem that YSOs may be commutative, but they are not distributive. Or your DoS is going to invite you for an interview to tell you that you have now missed too many Supers, and you are officially on the Watch List for insufficient work. Or your mother is going to send you a WhatsApp telling you that they can’t come up to Cambsville this weekend with emergency supplies of sugar, lard, chocolate, and pastry – as planned – so you will starve next week.  Whatever it is, if it’s sunny in February in Week 4 of Lent Term, it’s dangerous. That’s just inviting the Gods to do something really, really nasty. It is bad enough that we’re getting to within a few days of Division of Term, and therefore Depression and Exhaustion Week … but it’s also February.  Now, for the First Years, just in case you don’t know, February is Depression Month at Cambridge. Most months are Depression Month for one reason or other … October is Depression Month because of your lack of success at pulling anything other than a dead dog at any of the 26 Freshers Week parties that you went to, because by mid-October you were already more than a month behind in your work, because the glamorous room that College has given you the honour of paying an exorbitant, non-negotiable, rent turns out to be cold, noisy, damp, cramped, uncomfortable and tatty (and those are its better qualities), because your Supers partners turn out to have acute halitosis, severe personality disorders, and are either catatonically silent in Supers, or determined to dominate every second of the Super, without any regard to your existence, let alone your education. And that’s just October. Then follow a number of subsequent months each with a semi-infinite set of reasons for further deterioration of you mental, physical, and mathematical health.  But then comes February. February is the worst. Lack of sunshine, lack of nutrition (if you insist on eating in College, the Golden Arches, and the Van of Death and otherwise eating Sainsbury’s Basics white bread and instant coffee then don’t be surprised at suffering from growing nutritional deficiencies), lack of sex, lack of fresh air, lack of fun, lack of being-able-to-answer-anything-on-every-Examples-Sheet … just everything just combines to make February the most depressing month.  I know about this. When I was a student it got to the point that my Tutor (a loathsome creature at the best of times … and I discovered later someone that my father, back when he was up, loathed as one of the most vile snakes at Caius) would wake up and laugh at me when I turned up at his office to announce that I was going to quit Cambridge, saying something along the lines that … “ah, it must be February, Bursill-Hall has turned up to say he’s quitting Cambridge”. He was the very soul, the very picture of empathy … and yes, every year I would decide to bail out in February. For some reason I didn’t, but I don’t remember there was any particularly good reason. It was February, after all.  So, it is February. You should be aware that it is Depression Month (as if January were much better), and is followed by March, which is at least as miserable. But February is a pretty crap month. If you’re feeling depressed, frustrated, low-energy, bored, irritated, annoyed by just about everything, if you’re sleeping badly, sleeping too little, sleeping too much, not sleeping, sleeping all day, if College and everyone around you is simply irritating, or humiliating, or oppressive, if maths is a lot less fun than it should be … then be cheered & happy: you’re normal. If you are not feeling depressed, then you’re probably from the Southern Hemisphere, and you’re living somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, and you’re enjoying late summer. But otherwise, if you live in Cambridge and you’re not depressed, you are probably taking too many drugs and ought to think about cutting back (but not right now … maybe in June).  It’s not like you can actually DO anything about February Depression, and it’s not like I’m about to offer you a recipe for avoiding it, or lessening it, or getting out from underneath it. Obviously more sex and drugs and rock’n’roll would be nice, but they won’t cure February Depression. Generally, more sex makes things better, but you’re a mathmo so that’s not an option. Better food (more FiveGuys) offers temporary relief, but a daily dose of 5G is probably not recommended by doctors and the like. A CARE package from your mother with sugar, lard, and chocolate would help – which is why you need to phone your mother and gently hint that a CARE package would be much appreciated – necessary! – sometime soon (like, next week). Of course, you miss her and you’d love to see her and your younger siblings (not; but just lie), but what you really need is to be left alone and sent a large – and I mean really large – CARE package. Ask your mother to remember when she was at uni, and didn’t she get the February Blues?  But it won’t stop February Depression. Nothing can. You are going to hit a wall sometime soon (if you haven’t already) that is a combination of Week Five, February, endless cold, miserable, grey weather, and Cambridge. That’s a pretty poisonous combination, so beware: it is coming. The best you can do is go and stock up on chocolate (and Five Guys, but that is obvious) and other essential foods like doughnuts, crisps, and beer, come to today’s HoM lecture, and otherwise stay in bed under the covers. You might try starting your own batch of home-made Marmite. Tempting though it is, downloading more pornography probably won’t help, and binge-watching Netflix trashy films about some dystopian future will just add to your depression. Chocolate and History of Maths at 4 pm. That’s the only thing that will help. Trust me …  And today I shall continue on about ‘low maths’ and the arithmetical, applied tradition in the Middle Ages, and I shall probably – probably, that’s not a promise – get to the start of the Renaissance. You thought things were amazing so far? Nothing compared to what is going to happen in the 15th and 16th centuries. Bring seatbelts to Renaissance maths lectures, because it is going to be just simply, utterly awesome. And at the end of it all, what do you have? Yes, that long awaited, exclusive, once-in-a-lifetime annual lecture on Descartes. OhMyGod, PB-H’s Descartes Lecture. Yes, it is likely to happen sometime in the near future. Watch This Space.  So, today, 4 pm, Zoom: what happens with that applied, arithmetical ‘low maths’ medieval story?. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Are you ready for this? Can you handle Cambridge, February, Brexshit, and Friday’s lecture? These are times that test the mettle of even the strongest.  So, 4 pm. Miss it, and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.    Stay safe, stay well, and keep your mask on, even in bed, in the shower, and particularly when kissing YSO.  p bursill-hall"
