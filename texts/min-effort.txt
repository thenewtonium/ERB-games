# The bare minimum

[greeting]!!

Not to be [adjective] 🥺 but I noticed you’ve [past participle (transitive)] 🤓📚 my messages 📱and I haven’t 😭 heard back 👂

Concert 🎻 is in literally four 4️⃣ [period of time (plural)] 🌞🌛 and it’s a pretty [adjective] 🕴 event, like the master and her [noun] 👩‍❤️‍👩 are gonna be there! It’s the only black [article of clothing] 💂‍♀️ concert of the [period of time].

I feel like ❤️ at this point 🕰 the bare 🐻 minimum 🌡 is that we at least know 🧠 what you’re even [verb ending -ing | playing] 🎼 at the concert :((

I’ve sent 📮 a lot of [plural noun] 🔡 about this, and it takes about zero ⭕️ [plural or mass noun] to just say 😮‍💨 what movements 💃🕺 of your piece you’re { playing }.

I totally understand that a lot of us have just come out 🏳️‍🌈 from [noun phrase] 📖 and might not have had the time 🕑 to [verb (bare infinitve)] properly yet, but you are all 👩‍🔬👨‍🚒🧑‍🚀🧙‍♂️🧜 incredibly [adjective] musicians who know your [noun] and give a [adjective] list 🧾 of movements to commit 💎 to.

Programme notes 📜 aside ↪️, could I at least 🥺 know what movements of things are getting [past participle (transitive)]?

Programme notes 📜 not aside ⤵️, programmes will want to be designed/typed/[past participle (transitive)] very soon, so if we could have these ASAP that would also be [adjective].

I really hate 😢 to be [adjective] 🤡💩 but y’all have done a [university] degree 🎓 (congratulations!) and this is [adverb] a minimal effort thing you could do in [nonnegative integer] minutes hungover 🧟

Ok sorry for the essay 😪 but you’ve been on my [part of the body] lately 😳 and I was hoping 😔 you’d text me back [adverb] 👉👈…
