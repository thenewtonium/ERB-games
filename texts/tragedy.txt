# The Tragedy of ______ The Wise

Did you ever hear the tragedy of [person's name | plagueis] The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story [group of people] would tell you. It's a [group of people | sith] legend. {plagueis} was a [occupation] of (the) {sith}, so [adjective] and so wise he could use the [noun | force] to influence the [plural noun] to [verb phrase]… He had such a knowledge of [noun phrase] that he could even keep the ones he cared about from [verb ending -ing]. The dark side of the {force} is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his [noun], which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his [noun | apprentice] everything he knew, then his {apprentice} killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
